	 But first, A little Background:<br>
	 <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paphos" target="_blank"</p>Paphos</a> (/ˈpæfɒs/ PAF-oss; Greek: Πάφος [ˈpafos]; Turkish: Baf[3]; Armenian: Փաֆոս) is a coastal city in southwest Cyprus and the capital of Paphos District.<br>
	 In classical antiquity, two locations were called Paphos: Old Paphos, today known as Kouklia, and New Paphos</p>
	  The current city of Paphos lies on the Mediterranean coast, about 50 km (30 mi) west of Limassol (the biggest port on the island), both of which are connected by the A6 highway. Paphos International Airport is the country's second-largest airport.
<br>	 The city has a subtropical-Mediterranean climate, with the mildest temperatures on the island.
